## About PAMI
PAttern MIning (PAMI) is an important knowledge discovery technique in the data mining. Its objective is to discover 
interesting patterns hidden in big data. Several theoretical models and efficient algorithms have been described in the
literature to find different types of patterns in big data.  However, the popular adoption and the successful societal 
application of these algorithms has been hindered due to the lack of unified open-source libraries. Few researchers have 
attempted to address this non-trivial and challenging problem by introducing Java-based open source libraries, such as 
[WEKA](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) and [SPMF](https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/).  **Unfortunately, 
these Java-based libraries are inadequate to satisfy the information needs of the data scientists who perform analytics 
on Big Data mostly using Python language.**

With this motivation, I have initiated PAMI project to empower data scientists with necessary tools to discover patterns
hidden in Big Data. The motivation to carryout PAMI project happened while I was working at the [Kitsuregawa lab](http://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/new/?lang=en),
[The University of Tokyo](https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), Japan.  The work on PAMI started after I joined as an assistant professor at the [University of Aizu](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/), Japan. 
Most of the algorithms in PAMI were developed by my students and interns. Few of the algorithms were developed by the 
students of my PhD advisor, [Prof. P. Krishna Reddy](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pkreddy/), [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), India.
